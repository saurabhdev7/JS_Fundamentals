// -------------------------------- DOM --------------------------------

// 1. What is the DOM? 

//  The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating (add, remove, modify) HTML and XML documents.

// The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.
